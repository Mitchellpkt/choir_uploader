<h1>Ground rules</h1>

<i>You must agree to, and follow, all of the below rules if you wish to participate in penetration testing.</i><br><br>

The web app is hosted on a single computer, with the hostname <b>PwnMeComputer</b><br><br>

<b>All other devices on the network are strictly off limits</b> since they do not all belong to me.<br><br>

Anything on that computer is <i>fair game</i> for attack (except leave the mic/camera alone; don't be a creep).<br><br>

<i>Brief</i> denial of service attacks against the hosting *computer* are OK, if being used to gain access some clever way. However, do not DDoS the house's internet, since I share that! <br><br>

I use this demo to show collaborators and colleagues, so do not sustain a DoS attack.<br><br>

The computer is non-critical, contains no confidential information, and all code is backed up elsewhere, so don't be afraid to break something if it'll help you out.<br><br>

All passwords used on the machine & project are NOT used anywhere else. So feel free to hack out passwords; you won't accidentally find my email passphrase or anything.<br><br>

The speech recognition API charges per second translated. I have some credit saved up for the service, and it is not very expensive, so don't be afraid to use it manually. However, please DON'T upload files en masse in such a way that would run up my bill. I don't mind spending $20 on this project, but can't spend $200...<br><br>

Feel free to open pull requests or issues if you encounter bugs (whether security-related or not) or add enhancements.<br><br>

Please keep notes, because we'll want to learn from how you pulled it off. :- )<br><br>

Lastly, and most importantly:<br><br>
